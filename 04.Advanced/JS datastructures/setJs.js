//Set is a built-in data structure that represents a collection of unique values. Unlike arrays, set
//allows you to store only unique values, which means duplicate values are automatically removed.
// Each values can only occur once within a set.

//Set objects are useful when you need to store a list of unique elements  and quickly check for the
//existence of a specific value
